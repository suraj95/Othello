# Game of Othello

This repository contains the source code for a project I had done around 3 years ago. I am commiting this as a part of my efforts for some career moves, like brushing up data structures/algorithms for interviews and keeping my Github profile updated. And I hope so that this source code helps others who are new in their coding journey.

This projects implements the game of Othello, also known as ConnectFour. A detailed look at how the program should behave can be found on the Official UCI ICS 32 project webpages [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics32/ProjectGuide/Project2/) and [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics32/ProjectGuide/Project4/)
